    "# Your First API Call - `client.chat.completions.create()`\n",
    "\n",
    "With our environment securely configured, it's time to make our first live API call. This is the moment where the theory becomes practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "The workhorse function for nearly all chat-based interactions is `client.chat.completions.create()`. This name tells us exactly what it does: using our authenticated `client`, we are asking to `create` a `completion` for a `chat`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: While we are focusing on the `chat.completions` endpoint, the OpenAI platform offers other powerful tools like `embeddings` for text-to-vector conversion (used in RAG), `images` for DALL-E image generation, and `audio` for speech-to-text. To keep it focused, we will be focusing exclusively on chat in this course.\n",
    "> \n",
    "\n",
    "For this first call, we only need to provide the two most important, required parameters: `model` and `messages`. Let's see how they work."
