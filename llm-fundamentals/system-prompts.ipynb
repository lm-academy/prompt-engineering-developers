    "# System Prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome! In this notebook, we'll explore one of the most powerful features of modern chat-based LLMs: the **System Prompt**.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we discussed, an API call to a chat model consists of a list of messages, each with a `role`. While the `user` role is for the immediate task, the `system` role is your tool for setting the AI's long-term behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it this way:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **System Prompt = The AI's Job Description** (persona, rules, and goals that apply to the whole conversation).\n",
    "- **User Prompt = The Task for the Day** (the specific question or command for right now).\n",
    "\n",
    "By setting a clear job description, you gain consistency, control, and efficiency. Let's see this in action by building a specialized assistant for a common developer task: **writing Conventional Commit messages.**"
