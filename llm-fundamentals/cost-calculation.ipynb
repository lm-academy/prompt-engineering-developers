    "## How Cost is Calculated\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome! This notebook provides the practical demonstration for our lecture on cost calculation. We've discussed the theory: API usage is priced on a **pay-per-token** basis, and the cost is a function of both the **input tokens** you send and the **output tokens** you receive.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula is:\n",
    "`Total Cost = (Input Tokens × Price per Input Token) + (Output Tokens × Price per Output Token)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's see how to apply this in practice. The most accurate way to calculate the cost of a specific API call is to use the `usage` object that is returned in the API's response. This object gives you the precise token counts, taking all guesswork out of the equation."
