    "## How Cost is Calculated\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome! This notebook provides the practical demonstration for our lecture on cost calculation. We've discussed the theory: API usage is priced on a **pay-per-token** basis, and the cost is a function of both the **input tokens** you send and the **output tokens** you receive.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula is:\n",
    "`Total Cost = (Input Tokens × Price per Input Token) + (Output Tokens × Price per Output Token)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's see how to apply this in practice. The most accurate way to calculate the cost of a specific API call is to use the `usage` object that is returned in the API's response. This object gives you the precise token counts, taking all guesswork out of the equation."

      "\n",
      "### Step 1: Install Python\n",
      "Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Python 3.x is recommended since Python 2 has reached the end of its life.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 2: Check the Installation\n",
      "After installation, you can verify that Python and `pip` (Python’s package installer) are installed correctly by running the following commands in your terminal or command prompt:\n",
      "\n",
      "```bash\n",
      "python --version\n",
      "pip --version\n",
      "```\n",
      "or for Python 3 specifically:\n",
      "```bash\n",
      "python3 --version\n",
      "pip3 --version\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 3: Install `venv` Module (if necessary)\n",
      "For Python 3.3 and above, the `venv` module is included with standard Python installations. If you’re using an older version, you might need to install `virtualenv` using `pip`. However, using `venv` is now common and recommended for most situations.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can install `virtualenv` (if needed) with:\n",
      "```bash\n",
      "pip install virtualenv\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 4: Create a Virtual Environment\n",
      "Navigate to your project's directory using the command line and run the following command to create a virtual environment:\n",
      "\n",

      "```bash\n",
      "python3 -m venv myenv\n",

      "  ```bash\n",
      "  source myenv/bin/activate\n",
      "  ```\n",
      "\n",
      "Once activated, your terminal prompt will change to indicate that you’re now working inside the virtual environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 6: Install Packages\n",
      "With the virtual environment activated, you can now install packages using `pip`. For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "```bash\n",
      "pip install requests\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Install any other packages you need for your project.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 7: Deactivate the Virtual Environment\n",

      "\n",
      "```bash\n",
      "deactivate\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Your terminal will return to its normal state, indicating you are no longer working within the virtual environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 8: Remove a Virtual Environment (if necessary)\n",
      "If you need to delete a virtual environment, simply deactivate it (if it's currently activated) and then delete the directory where the virtual environment is located:\n",
      "\n",
      "```bash\n",
      "rm -r myenv      # macOS/Linux\n",

      "These three libraries—NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib—cover foundational aspects of data analysis, manipulation, and visualization in Python. Together, they form a powerful toolkit that is widely used in data science and many other areas. Mastering them will give beginners a strong start in their Python programming journey and enable them to tackle a wide range of projects.\n",

In this example, we'll create a small dataset containing information about some students, including their names, ages, and scores in a test. We'll then perform some basic data manipulation and analysis with Pandas.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Example: Student Data Analysis with Pandas\n",
      "\n",
      "In this example, we will:\n",
      "1. Create a DataFrame from a dictionary containing student data.\n",
      "2. Display the DataFrame.\n",
      "3. Calculate and display the average score.\n",
      "4. Filter students who scored above a certain threshold.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step-by-step Code Example\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "# Step 1: Import the Pandas library\n",
      "import pandas as pd\n",
      "\n",
      "# Step 2: Create a dictionary containing student data\n",
      "data = {\n",
      "    'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David', 'Eva'],\n",
      "    'Age': [22, 23, 21, 24, 22],\n",
      "    'Score': [85, 78, 92, 88, 95]\n",
      "}\n",
      "\n",
      "# Step 3: Create a DataFrame from the dictionary\n",
      "df = pd.DataFrame(data)\n",
      "\n",
      "# Step 4: Display the DataFrame\n",
      "print(\"Student Data:\")\n",
      "print(df)\n",
      "\n",
      "# Step 5: Calculate the average score\n",
      "average_score = df['Score'].mean()\n",
      "print(f\"\\nAverage Score: {average_score:.2f}\")\n",
      "\n",
      "# Step 6: Filter students with scores above a threshold (e.g., 90)\n",
      "high_scorers = df[df['Score'] > 90]\n",
      "\n",
      "# Step 7: Display the high scorers\n",
      "print(\"\\nStudents with Scores above 90:\")\n",
      "print(high_scorers)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Explanation of the Code\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Importing Pandas**: We start by importing the `pandas` library, which we will use for data manipulation.\n",
      "  \n",
      "2. **Creating Data**: We define a dictionary `data` where each key corresponds to a column in our DataFrame (i.e., 'Name', 'Age', and 'Score'). The values are lists containing the respective data.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Creating a DataFrame**: Using `pd.DataFrame(data)`, we convert the dictionary into a Pandas DataFrame, which is a tabular data structure similar to a spreadsheet.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Displaying the DataFrame**: We print out the DataFrame to see the data we've created.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Calculating the Average Score**: Using the `.mean()` method on the 'Score' column of the DataFrame, we calculate and print the average score of all students.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Filtering Data**: We create a new DataFrame `high_scorers` that contains only the rows where students have scores greater than 90. This is done using a condition inside the DataFrame indexing.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Displaying High Scorers**: Finally, we print out the list of students who scored above 90.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Running the Code\n",
      "You can run this code snippet in a Python environment where Pandas is installed (you can use Jupyter Notebook, an IDE like PyCharm, or directly in a Python script). Make sure to install Pandas first, using:\n",
      "\n",
      "```bash\n",
      "pip install pandas\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Expected Output\n",
      "If you run the code, you should see output similar to the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
